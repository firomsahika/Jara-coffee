His family's coffee-growing tradition originated with Mr. Israel Degefa's grandmother, Mrs. Wagayehu Bekele Debela, who instilled sustainable farming values at Bale Mountain Farm.</p></div></div><div class="flex gap-3 min-w-full"><div class="flex flex-col items-center gap-3"><div class="w-[16px] h-[16px] rounded-full bg-[#754C27] border-2 border-white"></div><h1 class="transform rotate-90 font-bold text-[16px] font-serif mt-2"></h1></div><div class="-mt-2 w-full"><h1 class="text-[20px] font-bold font-serif">Expanding</h1><p class="font-serif text-[16px] text-[#767676] mt-2">Building on this strong foundation, Mr. Israel Degefa transformed the family legacy into Kerchanshe Coffee—now Ethiopia’s largest coffee producer and exporter. Over the past 15 years, Kerchanshe Coffee has grown from humble beginnings into a global leader in the coffee industry, employing over 1,900 permanent staff and 25,000 seasonal workers. The company’s operations directly and indirectly impact the livelihoods of more than 1 million coffee growers across southern and southwestern Ethiopia, staying true to its heritage of quality and sustainability.</p></div></div><div class="flex gap-3 min-w-full"><div class="flex flex-col items-center gap-3"><div class="w-[16px] h-[16px] rounded-full bg-[#754C27] border-2 border-white"></div><h1 class="transform rotate-90 font-bold text-[16px] font-serif mt-2"></h1></div><div class="-mt-2 w-full"><h1 class="text-[20px] font-bold font-serif">Leading Coffee Expert</h1><p class="font-serif text-[16px] text-[#767676] mt-2">Bale Mountain Farm remains a shining example of the commitment to tradition and innovation that defines Kerchanshe Coffee. Under Mr. Israel Degefa’s stewardship, the farm has seen significant improvements, including the implementation of drip irrigation systems and the use of high-quality, chemical-free coffee seedlings.

The goal is to place water directly into the root zone and minimize evaporation. Drip irrigation systems distribute water through a network of valves, pipes, tubing, and emitters. Depending on how well they are designed, installed, maintained, and operated, a drip irrigation system can be more efficient than any other irrigation system, such as surface irrigation or sprinkler irrigation.

Major crops include coffee, pulses, oilseeds, sugarcane, vegetable and cotton, cereals like sorghum, wheat, barley, and millet.\",\"PARAGRAPH_2\":\"Coffee along with sesame and pulses are the chief cash/export crops. Pastoralism and livestock farming is also a key component of the agricultural sector. In Ethiopia, livestock help determine wealth and social status.

Camels are also used for milk, meat as well as in transportation especially in Rift Valley and adjacent areas.

These areas are generally above 2400m above sea level; average daily temperature ranges from freezing to 16 degree Celsius, with March, April, and May being the warmest months. All through the year, the midday warmth diminishes swiftly by afternoon, and nights are generally cold. During most months, light frost is formed at night and highest elevations experience snowfall. Lower areas of the plateau, between 1500-2400m above sea level, constitute the temperate zone. Daily temperature ranges from 16 degrees to 30 degrees Celsius.\",\"PARAGRAPH_3\":\"The hot zone comprises areas where the elevation is below 1500 meters.

And we want to share that, the tradition and the culture.\",\"p1\":\"The beautiful and unique coffee ceremony is a tradition in Ethiopia which takes time to celebrate friendship, hospitality, and respect. If you are offered an Ethiopian coffee ceremony, your obligations as a guest are simple – accept, enjoy, and don’t rush off anywhere else. The coffee ceremony is an art form. It is considered courteous to present the hostess with a small gift.\",\"p2\":\"The ceremonial preparation of coffee is usually performed by a young woman who wears an elegant white cotton dress embroidered upon its borders and hem with colourful patterns. Her hair will often be dressed in traditional shuruba braids, which are intricate patterns worked close to the scalp. A home will often be prepared with fresh grass strewn on the floor, which symbolises abundance.\",\"p3\":\"Firstly, she burns frankincense to rid the air of evil spirits and cleanse the atmosphere. In the presence of guests, she roasts green beans in a skillet above an open fire or stove. The beans are shaken regularly to prevent scorching. Soon, the delicious aromas of roasting coffee beans fill the air.\",\"p4\":\"When the sizzling coffee oils begin to make a popping sound the hostess will remove the skillet from the flame and bring the smoking beans toward the guests for them to appreciate the aroma, which is the guests’ cue to compliment. The dark beans are now ground by hand with mukecha and zenezena stick, or mortar and pestle and the ground coffee transferred to a jebena, a clay pitcher with a bulbous round bottom for holding the brewed coffee, a long stem, and a narrow spout.\",\"p5\":\"The jebena is filled with water and set upon the fire to boil. The guests relax, chat, and eat traditional snacks such as fendisha – popcorn – and kolo or dry, roasted grain.\",\"p6\":\"Often the coffee will be decanted and re-brewed three times before it is deemed ready. Now, the hostess brings out a traditional wooden tray of bunna or coffee cups called sinis and skilfully pours the coffee from a height of about a foot into the cups so that it bubbles and froths. Usually the strong black coffee is served with plenty of sugar, but the countryside you might be served salt or butter. Smile and enjoy!\",\"p7\":\"It is traditional to serve three rounds of the small sinis. Each time the hostess should be complimented on the quality, taste and preparation of the coffee. These are known as abal, tona and Baraka, which some say represent the elevation of spirit experienced by the drinker. Baraka means ‘blessing’ and in this way, the guest is being blessed by enjoying the coffee ceremony together with their hosts.\",\"imageCaption\":\"The perfect cup of Coffee\"},\"coffeeHistory\":{\"title\":\"Coffee History\",\"heading\":\"Coffee: The Heart of Ethiopian Culture\",\"paragraph1\":\"Coffee is not just a beverage in Ethiopia; it is a central part of the culture and daily life.
